# Welcome to the JHWEB!
JHWEB is my reading portfolio site.  
JHWEB is the result of the 2018 undergraduate web programming class.  
Up until now, the development status had stopped.  
I will develop and use this website in a better direction in the future.  

I would appreciate it if you could recommend a book to read.
